# JPDB_record_insertion

Description:
  This is one of the part of Student registration system in which student data is inserted in the database.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:
  We dont have to make a Schema initially for storing the records inspite with the help of jpdb querry the schema got created and the records are inserted accordingly.

One can findd about other JPDB methods via this
  http://login2explore.com/jpdb/resources/js/0.0.4/jpdb-commons.js

Table of contents:
  It includes 3 fields that are the record content which we are suppose to inssert in the database.
  
Illustrations:
  When we run it on any server it ask you to enter the Student id/USN, Student Name, Student mail id an then there is a button which on click saves our data with some 
  alerts on the page alerting that the data are successfully inserted with no error. If there is some problem in connecting to databse then it will alert for an error
  showing wrong Token. So, make sure that the Connection Token is carefully added when creating a PUT request.
  
Scope of functionalities
This type of applications are useful when there is insertion of so many records at a time and to reduce redudancy in the records one must use something to eliminate this.
So, in that case this application helps alot. Since it's just a part of a project there is much more things in this type of application. Using this one can not only insert
a reocrd, this can be used to perform other operations like update, delete etc on records inserted.

Examples of use
In colleges/Schools at the admission,
In Libraries for recording the books informations, etc

Project status
I had made a project ONLINE COURSE REGISTRATION which is not using JPDB but using SQL DB to storer the record and there are much more things in that.
